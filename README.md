# AI Butler

An AI assistant to help retrieving information from my blog [STEMhash.com](https://stemhash.com).

AI Butler uses [OpenAI's Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview). This implementation is an improvement from my previous one [here](https://github.com/ilee38/llm-semantic-search)â€“which didn't use an assistant.

I also wrote a blog post detailing the process of creating the assistant: [My AI Butler: Semantic Search Part II](https://stemhash.com/ai-assistant/).
